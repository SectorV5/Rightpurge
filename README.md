# Rightpurge
Rightpurge is a browser extension that blocks Nazi and right-wing extremist websites, protecting you from hate speech and harmful content. It prevents connections to listed sites, ensuring they donâ€™t load or track your IP. Users can manage a custom blocklist via an intuitive popup, adding or removing sites with ease. Blocking is enforced before any network request reaches the site. Rightpurge is open-source, licensed under GPLv3.
